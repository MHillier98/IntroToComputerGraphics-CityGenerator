# Development Setup
To run this, you will have to host a local server for your dev environment.

First, install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

`npm install http-server -g`

Open the base folder, type in `http-server -c-1` to start a local server.

If you do not run this from a server, images don't seem to load at all.
