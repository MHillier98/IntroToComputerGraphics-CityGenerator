# UTS 31264 Introduction To Computer Graphics - Final Project
This project was built as the final project for Introduction to Computer Graphics, in Autumn 2019.

This is a city generator built in [three.js](https://threejs.org/) to explore different graphics techniques and procedural generation.


## Development Setup
To run this, you will have to host a local server for your dev environment. If you don't run this from a server, images don't seem to load at all.

First, install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Use the command `npm install http-server -g` to do so.


## Running the City Generator
Open the base folder and type in the command `http-server -c-1` to start a local server.

Then go to one of the available addresses to view and use the city builder (these will change depending on your configuration):
* `http://192.168.43.7:8080/index` 
* `http://127.0.0.1:8080/index`
* `http://localhost:8080/index`
